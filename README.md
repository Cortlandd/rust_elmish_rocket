# What?

A reorganization of https://github.com/aochagavia/rocket a demo rust game, using the Elm architecture http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html.

# Why?

For fun.

# Notes

On my system homebrew links to /opt/boxen/homebrew/lib

So, export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/boxen/homebrew/lib" or export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH/opt/boxen/homebrew/lib" in order to link to SDL2.
